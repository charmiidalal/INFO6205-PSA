* Implement three methods of a class called Timer. Timer is invoked from a class called Benchmark_Timerwhich implements the Benchmark interface. Check your implementation by running the unit tests in BenchmarkTest andTimerTest.

* Implement InsertionSort by simply looking up the insertion code used by Arrays.sort. You should use the helper.swap method although you could also just copy that from the same source code. You should of course run the unit tests in InsertionSortTest.

* Implement a main program to actually run the following benchmarks: measure the running times of this sort, using four different initial array ordering situations: random, ordered, partially-ordered and reverse-ordered. Use the doubling method for choosing n and test for at least five values of n. Draw any conclusions from your observations regarding the order of growth.

* Report on your observations and show screenshots of the runs and also the unit tests.
